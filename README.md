My first take on React is this simple little app.

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of React, so I've used simple and class components, state, props, and submitting form data.

I wanted to try out pulling in data from an API, so I've made a test app in Api.js that pulls data from a URL endpoint. Change the URL in index.js to try it out!
